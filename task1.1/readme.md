***I practiced working with git (brunches, commits, repositories).
Three brunches were created - there were additional files in different folders, as well as changes in one file, which created conflicts (that were successfully resolved).***

**In the first task I used the next commands, successfuly used it in practice and learnt it:**

*git clone
git add .
git commit -m “ “
git branch
git checkout
git checkout -b 
git merge 
git rebase
git logs
git reset HEAD~1
git revert HEAD
git cherry-pick 
git push origin --all
git reflog
git push*
